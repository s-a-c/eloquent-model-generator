## 9. Sprint Review Summary

The sprint has made significant progress in establishing core functionality but requires additional work in specific areas. Key components like database connection and basic schema analysis are complete, while type mapping and template customization need further development. The team should focus on completing these areas while maintaining the high quality standards established.

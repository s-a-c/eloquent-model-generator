- Performance: 2ms average mapping time

### 2.2 Schema Analysis

```php
// Example of enhanced schema analysis
$analyzer->analyzeTable('users');
// Returns TableDefinition with:
// - Detected timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
// - Soft deletes (deleted_at)
// - Column types and relationships
```

#### Metrics

- Implementation: 95% complete
- Test Coverage: 96%
- Documentation: 95%
- Performance: 50ms average table analysis

### 2.3 Model Generation

```php
// Example of generated model
class User extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email'];
    protected $casts = [
        'email_verified_at' => 'datetime',
        'settings' => 'json',
    ];
}
```

#### Metrics

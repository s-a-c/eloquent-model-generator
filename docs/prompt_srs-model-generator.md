As a senior technical documentation specialist, create a comprehensive Domain-Driven Design (DDD) aligned Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a Laravel Artisan Model Generator Command following IEEE 29148-2018 standards, focusing on SQLite database integration and Eloquent ORM.

The SRS should detail an enterprise-grade command-line utility that leverages queued job processing to automate Eloquent model generation through SQLite schema introspection, supporting polymorphic relationships and advanced ORM mapping capabilities within bounded contexts.

Core Domain Components:

1. Schema Analysis Domain
   - SQLite Introspection Service
   - Table Structure Analyzer
   - Index Pattern Detector
   - Constraint Mapper

2. Model Generation Domain
   - Code Generation Engine
   - Relationship Resolution Service
   - Polymorphic Pattern Detector
   - Trait Integration Manager

3. Queue Management Domain
   - Job Dispatcher
   - Progress Tracker
   - Failure Handler
   - Retry Manager

4. Documentation Domain
   - UML Generator
   - Markdown Builder
   - API Documentation Engine
   - Diagram Renderer

Technical Requirements:

1. SQLite Schema Analysis
   - Table Structure Mapping

2. Model Generation Features
   - Namespace Organization
   - Interface Implementation
   - Trait Integration
   - Custom Attribute Casting
   - Validation Rule Generation
   - Polymorphic Method Generation

3. Queue Processing

# Sprint 1 Log - Domain Implementation

## Roo prompt

```prompt
/Architect
create a prompt for Roo Code.
The prompt should cause Roo Code to complete all the tasks in `docs/sprints/sprint2.md`
Create all the specified deliverables to achieve the sprint goals.
log all activities in `docs/sprints/sprint2.log.md`, include timestamps and durations, include a catalog of all outputs/deliverables
the deliverables/outputs should adhere to DDD, SOLID, functional programming paradigm, laravel best practice and conventions.
finally:
- update sprint2.md, marking checkboxes
- update `VERSION_HISTORY.md` and `version_history.md` appropriately
- execute `git add .`
- add to the sprint log, a comprehensive `git commit` command, using multiple `-m` switches and `\` line continuation
- add to the sprint log a suitable `git tag` command
```

## Progress Updates

### 2025-02-17 13:09

Completed core domain models and initial type system implementation:

- Implemented Type interface with clear contract for type behavior
- Created AbstractType to reduce code duplication
- Implemented StringType as first concrete type
- Created ModelDefinition and Property value objects
- Implemented TypeResolver service for type resolution

### 2025-02-17 13:10

Completed functional programming core:

- Implemented Compose utility with pure function composition
- Created immutable Collection class with generic type support
- Added comprehensive collection operations
- Ensured type safety through PHP 8 features and docblock annotations

### 2025-02-17 13:13

Completed domain services implementation:

- Created ModelGenerator for generating Eloquent model classes
- Implemented ValidationBuilder for Laravel validation rules
- Added RelationshipDetector for automatic relationship detection
- Used functional programming patterns throughout services
- Ensured immutability and type safety in all operations

### 2025-02-17 13:14

Completed infrastructure setup:

- Implemented Laravel service provider for DI container integration
- Created comprehensive configuration system
- Set up service registration and bootstrapping
- Configured default type mappings
- Added package customization options

## Challenges & Solutions

- Ensured proper immutability in value objects by using readonly properties
- Implemented fluent interfaces for property modifications while maintaining immutability
- Used generics and strict typing for better type safety
- Designed Collection class to be both type-safe and immutable
- Leveraged PHP 8's features for better type checking
- Implemented complex relationship detection logic using pattern matching
- Used functional programming patterns for cleaner code structure
- Created flexible configuration system for package customization

## Deliverables Catalog

### Domain Models

- `src/Domain/Type/Type.php`: Core type interface
- `src/Domain/Type/AbstractType.php`: Base type implementation
- `src/Domain/Type/StringType.php`: String type implementation
- `src/Domain/Model/ModelDefinition.php`: Model definition value object
- `src/Domain/Model/Property.php`: Property value object

### Services

- `src/Domain/Type/TypeResolver.php`: Type resolution service
- `src/Domain/Service/ModelGenerator.php`: Model generation service
- `src/Domain/Service/ValidationBuilder.php`: Validation rules builder
- `src/Domain/Service/RelationshipDetector.php`: Relationship detection service

### Functional Core

- `src/Domain/Functional/Compose.php`: Function composition utilities
- `src/Domain/Functional/Collection.php`: Immutable collection implementation

### Infrastructure

4. Add package documentation

## Roo Code Summary

Sprint 1 completed successfully. Implemented a comprehensive model generation system following DDD, SOLID, and functional programming principles. Deliverables include:

Core Domain:

- Type system with interface, abstract base, and concrete implementations
- Immutable value objects for model and property definitions
- Type resolution and mapping infrastructure

Functional Programming:

- Function composition utilities
- Type-safe immutable collection implementation
- Pure functional operations

Domain Services:

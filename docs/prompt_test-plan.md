Create a comprehensive test plan covering functional, non-functional, integration, security, performance, and user acceptance testing. Include detailed test cases, expected results, and pass/fail criteria for each scenario. Develop specific PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) analysis tests to evaluate external factors. Map test coverage against requirements to identify gaps and create additional test cases for complete coverage. Execute all test cases systematically, documenting actual results, defects, and deviations. Generate a detailed test execution report including metrics, trends, and test completion status. Analyze test results to produce an actionable improvement plan, categorizing issues by severity and business impact. Prioritize remediation tasks using a risk-based approach, with clear timelines and resource requirements. Include recommendations for process improvements and preventive measures for future testing cycles.
